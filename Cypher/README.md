CALL { :load verification-script.cypher }

// Run comprehensive diagnostics
CALL { :load diagnostic-scripts.cypher }
```

### **Common Issues**
- **Layer Detection**: Low confidence scores, manual classification needed
- **Team Alignment**: Poor specialization match, reassignment required
- **Dependency Violations**: Layer progression issues, sprint rebalancing needed
- **Capacity Problems**: Over/under capacity, workload redistribution required

### **Manual Corrections**
```cypher
// Fix layer classification
MATCH (flow:Flow {app: 'AppName', flow: 'FlowName'})
SET flow.muleLayer = 'CORRECT_LAYER', flow.layerConfidence = 95;

// Adjust team specialization
MATCH (team:AgileTeam {name: 'Team Name'})
SET team.primaryLayer = 'NEW_LAYER';
```

**Version**: 2.0 - Layer-Aware Architecture
**Updated**: Current with Mule 3-layer architecture support
**Status**: Production-ready with comprehensive documentation 

###  Team-Aware Sprint Planning (v2)
The script `application-team-balanced-sprint-planning.cypher` now:
1. Performs its **own cleanup** – it deletes all `Sprint` / `SprintBacklog` nodes and anything tagged `type:'planning'` before rebuilding the backlog, so you no longer need to run a separate cleanup step between plan iterations.
2. Uses a **team-aware round-robin** algorithm.  Each team’s flows are distributed across the 12 sprints so every sprint contains work for **Expert, Senior, and Standard** teams (assuming the input assignments give each team flows).
3. Tags each backlog row with `assignmentMethod:'TEAM_ROUND_ROBIN'`.

### Simplified cleanup script  `nuclear-cleanup.cypher`  (v2)
If you really want to wipe only the planning artefacts without touching domain data, run:
```cypher
:load Cypher/nuclear-cleanup.cypher   // deletes nodes/relationships where type='planning'
```

### New MS-Project export variant
`export-to-msproject-xml.cypher` generates Microsoft-Project XML where tasks inside each sprint are grouped by team (Expert → Senior → Standard) and have friendlier names (`<Team> | <App>::<Flow> (SP)`). Use this when you want a Gantt grouped by team lanes. 

### ⚖️ Automatic Team Rebalancer
If team workloads are highly skewed before planning, run
`rebalance-team-assignments.cypher`.
It iteratively moves medium-complexity, non-high-risk flows from the team with the most SP to the team with the least until totals are within ~20 % of each other (max 10 iterations).  Run it **before** executing the sprint-planning script:
```cypher
:load Cypher/rebalance-team-assignments.cypher
:load Cypher/application-team-balanced-sprint-planning.cypher
```
