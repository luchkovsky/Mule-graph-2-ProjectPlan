##  AGILE STORY POINTS METHODOLOGY

### **What Are Story Points?**

Story points are a unit of measure used to estimate the relative effort required to complete a user story or task. In our project, story points represent the **complexity and effort** required to migrate individual Mule flow to another technology.

### **Our Story Points Calculation Formula**

```
Story Points = Base Complexity + Risk Multiplier + API Bonus + DataWeave Complexity
```

**Components:**
- **Base Complexity**: Connector count, step count, architectural complexity
- **Risk Multiplier**: High-risk flows get 1.5x multiplier
- **API Bonus**: API-exposed flows get additional points
- **DataWeave Complexity**: Transformation logic complexity

### **Story Point Categories**

| Category | Points Range | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **TINY** | 1-2 | Simple flows, minimal logic | Basic HTTP listener |
| **SMALL** | 3-5 | Simple integration, basic transformation | Database query with simple mapping |
| **MEDIUM** | 6-8 | Moderate complexity, some business logic | API with validation and transformation |
| **LARGE** | 9-13 | Complex integration, multiple systems | Multi-system orchestration |
| **VERY_LARGE** | 14-20 | Very complex flows, extensive logic | Complex business process |
| **EPIC** | 21+ | Extremely complex, requires breakdown | Major integration hub |

### **Complexity Scoring Factors**

1. **Flow Complexity**

    | Parameter | Weight | Description | Complexity Reasoning |
    |-----------|-------:|-------------|----------------------|
    | Direct Step Count | 3 | Steps directly in the flow | Basic processing complexity |
    | Nested Step Count | 6 | Steps containing other steps | Nested logic increases complexity |
    | Deep Nested Step Count | 9 | Steps nested ≥3 levels deep | Deep nesting is exponentially complex |
    | Unique Step Types | 2 | Variety of step types used | More variety = more expertise needed |
    | Unique External References | 4 | External components referenced | Dependencies increase complexity |
    | ApiKit Reference Count | 2 | References to API specifications | API integration complexity |
    | Error Handler Count | 2 | Flow-specific error handlers | Error-handling complexity |
    | Connectors Count | 3 | Integration Complexity | Integration Complexity |
     | DataWeave Component Complexity | Variable | DataWeave Complexity | Comprehensive DW complexity 

2. **API Complexity**
   - API kit routes: 2 points each
   - API schemas: 4 points each
   - API actions: 1 point each

3. **DataWeave Complexity**

   | Parameter | Weight | Description | Complexity Reasoning |
   |-----------|-------:|-------------|----------------------|
   | DataWeave Depth | 3 | Nesting depth of DW expressions | Deep nesting exponentially increases complexity |
   | Function Count | 2 | Custom functions defined | Custom functions add reusability but also complexity |
   | Filter Count | 2 | Number of filter operations | Filtering logic adds conditional paths |
   | Import Count | 1 | Number of module imports | External dependencies add mental overhead |
   | Call Count | 3 | Number of function calls | Each call introduces execution overhead and traceability cost |
   | Map Count | 2 | Number of map operations | Mapping operations add transformation complexity |
   | OrderBy, GroupBy Count | 2 | Number of Mule 3 operations | Mule 3 operations add transformation complexity |
   | Unique DataWeave Types | 3 | Variety of DW script types | Different DW patterns add complexity |
   

> **How it's used**  `ComplexityScore = Σ(parameterValue × Weight)` where *Variable* weight equals the parameter's own weight defined in the component catalogue.  
> The score is normalised (÷10)

**Flow Complexity Categories**

| Score Range | Category | Description |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| 100+ | VERY_HIGH | Extremely complex flows |
| 60-99 | HIGH | Highly complex flows |
| 30-59 | MEDIUM | Moderate complexity with advanced features |
| 0-9 | VERY_LOW | Minimal complexity flows |

### How to Use These Categories
1. Calculate each flow's `ComplexityScore` using the weighted parameters above.
2. Locate the resulting score in the table and assign the corresponding category.
3. During sprint planning use the category to:
   - Allocate flows to the most suitable team (see *Team Structure* section).
   - Select the appropriate Story Point band.
   - Determine the mandatory testing scope (see *Testing Strategy*).
4. Track category distribution across sprints to ensure balanced workload and risk.

### Why This Matters
* **Objective measurement** – replaces gut-feel with a repeatable metric.
* **Risk-based prioritisation** – VERY_HIGH and HIGH flows surface early in the roadmap.
* **Resource alignment** – matches complexity with team expertise, preventing overload.
* **Quality assurance** – scales testing effort in proportion to complexity.
* **Transparent communication** – provides a concise way to convey technical difficulty to non-technical stakeholders.

##  TESTING STRATEGY & EFFORT ESTIMATION

Robust testing is baked into our story-point model.  The effort allocated to testing grows with **flow complexity**, **layer criticality** and **connector surface area**.

### 1. Test Pyramid & Types
| Level | Test Type | Mule Layer Focus | Goal |
|-------|-----------|------------------|------|
| Unit   | MUnit, DW unit scripts | All layers | Validate small, isolated logic paths |
| Component | Flow-scope tests (with mocks) | System / Process | Verify flow orchestration & error handling |
| Integration | End-to-end with real connectors | System / Process | Ensure external systems & DB calls work |
| **End-to-End** | Cross-application scenario tests | All layers combined | Validate complete business workflow across systems |
| API / Contract | RAML-based tests (e.g., APIKit Console, OAS tests) | Experience | Guarantee contract correctness |
| Performance | Soak / load (JMeter, Gatling) | High-throughput flows | Validate latency & throughput targets |
| Security | AuthZ/AuthN, OWASP scans | Public APIs | Protect against common vulnerabilities |

### 2. Testing Effort Matrix
| Flow Complexity | Base Test Effort (% of SP) | Connector Count Modifier* | Layer Modifier** | Typical Test Suite |
|-----------------|---------------------------:|--------------------------:|-----------------:|-------------------|
| Low (≤5 comps)  | 10 % | +2 % if ≥3 ext. connectors | +0 % | Unit + happy-path component |
| Medium (6-12)   | 15 % | +3 % if ≥3 ext. connectors | +2 % if Experience layer | Unit + component + integration |
| High (>12)      | 20 % | +5 % if ≥3 ext. connectors | +5 % if Experience layer | Full pyramid incl. perf & security |

*External connectors = HTTP, DB, JMS, SAP, etc.  
**Experience-layer flows are user-facing; extra contract & security tests are mandatory.

### 3. How the Formula Works
```
TestingEffort = BaseTestEffort + ConnectorModifier + LayerModifier
StoryPointsTesting = round(StoryPoints * TestingEffort)
```
Example: High-complexity Experience flow with 4 connectors → 20 % + 5 % + 5 % = **30 %** testing overhead.

### 4. Automation Principles
1. **Shift-left** – write tests in parallel with code.
2. **Mocks first** – isolate external dependencies for fast feedback.
3. **CI gate** – fail the pipeline if any mandatory test tier fails.
4. **Test data management** – version-controlled stub datasets per environment.

### 5. End-to-End Scenario Coverage
End-to-End (E2E) tests stitch multiple applications and layers together—starting from an external API call (Experience layer), travelling through Process orchestration down to System integrations, then back to the caller.

* **Scope** – critical order-to-cash, customer-onboarding or other business journeys.
* **Environment** – dedicated staging environment with all target systems available or emulated.
* **Tooling** – Cucumber, Karate, Postman collections, Selenium (if UI involved).
* **Ownership** – jointly maintained by all teams; each sprint adds E2E scripts for the application completed in that sprint.
* **Effort Accounting** – E2E automation + execution effort is included in the *Performance/Security* row for High-complexity flows, typically adding **5-8 %** extra points at the release-candidate stage.

> Passing E2E tests is a hard gate for declaring an application "done".

> Allocating explicit story-point budget for testing ensures quality does not erode under schedule pressure and makes testing capacity transparent during sprint planning.

##  CRITICAL PATH ANALYSIS

### **What is Critical Path?**

The **Critical Path** is the sequence of dependent tasks that determines the minimum project duration. In our project, the critical path follows the **Mule 3-Layer Architecture dependencies**.

### **Our Critical Path: Layer Dependencies**

```
System Layer → Process Layer → Experience Layer
```

#### **Phase 1: System Layer Foundation (Sprints 1-4)**
- **Duration**: 8 weeks
- **Dependencies**: None (foundation work)
- **Risk**: Database connectivity, legacy system access
- **Critical Success**: Stable data access patterns

#### **Phase 2: Process Layer Orchestration (Sprints 5-8)**
- **Duration**: 8 weeks
- **Dependencies**: System layer completion
- **Risk**: Complex business logic, integration patterns
- **Critical Success**: Working business processes

#### **Phase 3: Experience Layer APIs (Sprints 9-12)**
- **Duration**: 8 weeks
- **Dependencies**: Process layer completion
- **Risk**: API contract changes, user experience
- **Critical Success**: Functional external interfaces

### **Critical Path Management**

1. **Early Risk Identification**: High-risk flows scheduled in first 4 sprints
2. **Dependency Tracking**: System flows cannot start until prerequisites complete
3. **Buffer Management**: 15% time buffer for critical path activities
4. **Resource Allocation**: Expert team assigned to critical path work

##  PROJECT TIMELINE OVERVIEW

The **Project Timeline** translates the critical-path phases into a simple calendar that everyone—developers, testers, managers, and business stakeholders—can reference at a glance.  It captures *when* each architectural layer will be migrated, the sprint boundaries, and the high-level objectives that drive acceptance criteria for each phase.

| Phase | Layer Focus | Sprint Range | Week Range | Primary Objective |
|-------|-------------|--------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Foundation** | System Layer | 1 – 4 | 1 – 8 | Establish core system integrations and data access patterns |
| **Orchestration** | Process Layer | 5 – 8 | 9 – 16 | Build business logic, orchestration flows, and error handling |
| **API Delivery** | Experience Layer | 9 – 12 | 17 – 24 | Expose stable external and internal APIs, complete contract tests |

### Project Timeline Parameters
| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Project Duration | **24 weeks** (12 sprints) | Aligns with Foundation → Orchestration → API Delivery phases |
| Sprint Length | **2 weeks** | Standard iteration allowing regular inspect-and-adapt cycles |
| Velocity (Total Capacity) | **60 story points / sprint** | Combined capacity of all teams as defined in Team Structure |
| Velocity Buffer | **15 %** (~9 SP per sprint) | Reserved for unplanned work, risk mitigation and scope changes |

**How to Use This Timeline**
1. Align sprint goals and backlog items with the phase objectives listed above.
2. Schedule cross-team dependencies so that downstream layers (Process, Experience) never begin before upstream layers (System, Process) reach their “definition of done.”
3. Communicate upcoming milestones to stakeholders using the week ranges as anchors for demos, testing cycles, and releases.
4. Re-evaluate phase boundaries during sprint reviews; if velocity changes, adjust the sprint range while keeping the sequential order intact.

> Keeping the timeline visible in sprint boards and status reports ensures that day-to-day task planning remains connected to the bigger delivery picture.

##  APPLICATION-BY-APPLICATION DELIVERY PRINCIPLE

Dependency-driven layer sequencing is only half of the story.  
Our primary objective is to **finish complete applications**—System, Process and Experience layers inclusive—so that business value is realised early and integration risk is contained within clear boundaries.

**Key guidelines**
1. **Vertical slices first** – Whenever possible select a *single application* (or a tightly-coupled cluster) and migrate all of its flows through every layer within the same set of sprints.
2. **Done means DONE** – An application is considered complete only when all flows are migrated, automated tests pass, documentation is updated and the app can be deployed independently.
3. **Cross-team collaboration** – Expert, Senior and Standard teams work in parallel on the chosen app, each owning flows that match their complexity range, mirroring the collaboration plan outlined in `PLANNING_SP.md`.
4. **Risk containment** – Finishing an application end-to-end reduces the window in which partially-migrated logic is in use, simplifying rollback and support.
5. **Business feedback loops** – Delivering a fully working application earlier enables stakeholders to validate behaviour and request adjustments before the bulk of the migration is complete.

> **Why not pure layer sequencing?**  In practise, working horizontally across all applications at once can create huge Work-In-Progress, slow feedback and complicate testing.  Combining **layer discipline inside an application** with an **application-by-application release rhythm** provides the best of both worlds.

##  BURN DOWN METHODOLOGY

### **What is Burn Down?**

A **Burn Down Chart** tracks the amount of work remaining in a sprint or project over time. It helps teams visualize progress and identify potential delivery risks.

### **Our Burn Down Approach**

#### **Sprint Burn Down**
- **X-Axis**: Days in sprint (1-10 working days)
- **Y-Axis**: Remaining story points
- **Target Line**: Linear decrease from sprint total to zero
- **Actual Line**: Daily remaining work tracking

#### **Project Burn Down**
- **X-Axis**: Sprint number (1-12)
- **Y-Axis**: Remaining story points (720 total)
- **Target Line**: 60 points per sprint reduction
- **Actual Line**: Cumulative completion tracking

### **Burn Down Metrics**

1. **Velocity**: Average story points completed per sprint
2. **Trend Line**: Linear regression of completion rate
3. **Variance**: Difference between planned and actual completion
4. **Forecast**: Projected completion date based on current velocity

### **Burn Down Analysis**

- **Ahead of Schedule**: Actual line below target line
- **On Schedule**: Actual line matches target line
- **Behind Schedule**: Actual line above target line
- **Scope Creep**: Upward movement in remaining work

##  ROADMAP BUILDING PRINCIPLES

### **Sprint Planning Phases**

#### **Phase 1: Foundation (Sprints 1-4)**
- **Layer Focus**: System layer
- **Timeline**: Weeks 1-8
- **Purpose**: Establish system integrations
- **Dependencies**: None (foundation work)
- **Risk Priority**: High-risk system flows early

#### **Phase 2: Orchestration (Sprints 5-8)**
- **Layer Focus**: Process layer
- **Timeline**: Weeks 9-16
- **Purpose**: Build business logic
- **Dependencies**: System layer completion
- **Risk Priority**: Complex orchestration flows

#### **Phase 3: API Delivery (Sprints 9-12)**
- **Layer Focus**: Experience layer
- **Timeline**: Weeks 17-24
- **Purpose**: Deliver external interfaces
- **Dependencies**: Process layer completion
- **Risk Priority**: API contract stability

### **Capacity-Constrained Scheduling**

#### **Sprint Capacity Rules**
- **Maximum 10 flows per sprint**: Avoid overcommitment
- **60 story points total per sprint**: Combined team capacity
- **Layer alignment bonus**: Flows matching sprint layer focus get priority

#### **Assignment Priority Scoring**
```
Total Score = Layer Alignment + Risk Priority + Team Specialization + Complexity Timing
```

**Components:**
- **Layer Alignment**: 15 points for perfect match
- **Risk Priority**: 8 points for high-risk early scheduling
- **Team Specialization**: 5 points for layer expertise match
- **Complexity Timing**: 3 points for optimal complexity distribution

### **Dependency Management**

#### **Layer Dependency Validation**
- **System Before Process**: System flows must complete before process flows
- **Process Before Experience**: Process flows must complete before experience flows
- **Violation Detection**: Automated dependency conflict identification

#### **Risk-Based Prioritization**
- **High-Risk Early**: Critical flows in first 4 sprints
- **Medium-Risk Middle**: Standard flows in middle sprints
- **Low-Risk Late**: Simple flows in final sprints

---

##  SUCCESS METRICS

### **Team Specialization Alignment**
- **Excellent**: 70%+ flows match team specialization
- **Good**: 50-70% flows match team specialization
- **Fair**: 30-50% flows match team specialization

### **Sprint Layer Focus**
- **Excellent**: 60%+ stories match sprint layer focus
- **Good**: 40-60% stories match sprint layer focus
- **Mixed**: <40% stories match sprint layer focus

### **Risk Distribution**
- **Balanced**: High-risk flows distributed early
- **Optimal**: <30% high-risk flows per team
- **Concerning**: >40% high-risk flows concentrated

### **Dependency Compliance**
- **Perfect**: No layer dependency violations
- **Good**: <5% dependency violations
- **Warning**: 5-10% dependency violations

##  SPRINT PLANNING APPROACHES

### **Overview of Planning Methodologies**

Our project supports **three distinct sprint planning approaches**, each optimized for different project characteristics, team compositions, and organizational priorities. Understanding the differences helps you choose the most appropriate approach for your specific migration context.

---

### **1.  IMPROVED SPRINT PLANNING (`improved-sprint-planning.cypher`)**

#### ** Approach**
- **Primary Focus**: **Risk-based prioritization**
- **Strategy**: Simple, straightforward risk-first assignment
- **Philosophy**: "Handle the riskiest work first"

#### ** How It Works**
1. **Risk Classification**: Automatically categorizes flows by risk level
2. **Priority Assignment**: Risk-based sprint distribution
3. **Sprint Mapping**: 
   - **HIGH_RISK** → Early sprints (1-4)
   - **MEDIUM_RISK** → Middle sprints (3-8)
   - **LOW_RISK** → Later sprints (5-12)

#### ** Creates**
- `SprintBacklog` nodes with risk metadata
- Simple project phases (Foundation, Core Migration, Integration, Finalization)

#### ** Best For**
- **Simple projects** with clear risk priorities
- **Small teams** (1-2 teams)
- **Time-constrained** migrations
- **Risk-averse** organizations
- **Proof-of-concept** projects

#### ** Limitations**
- No team specialization consideration
- No architectural layer dependencies
- Limited validation and analytics
- Basic capacity management

---

### **2.  LAYER-AWARE SPRINT PLANNING (`layer-aware-sprint-planning.cypher`)**

#### ** Approach**
- **Primary Focus**: **Architectural dependency management with team specialization**
- **Strategy**: Multi-dimensional planning considering layers, teams, and risk
- **Philosophy**: "Respect architectural dependencies while optimizing team expertise"

#### ** How It Works**
1. **Layer-First Scheduling**: Enforces SYSTEM → PROCESS → EXPERIENCE progression
2. **Team Specialization**: Matches flows to team expertise
3. **Complex Scoring**: Combines layer alignment + risk + team specialization + complexity timing
4. **Dependency Validation**: Prevents architectural violations
5. **Capacity Constraints**: Respects team capacity limits

#### ** Creates**
- `Sprint` nodes with layer focus
- `SprintItem` nodes with detailed metadata
- Comprehensive assignment relationships

#### ** Best For**
- **Complex migrations** with multiple architectural layers
- **Multiple specialized teams** (3+ teams)
- **Large codebases** with intricate dependencies
- **Enterprise environments** requiring compliance
- **Long-term projects** (6+ months)

#### ** Limitations**
- More complex setup and configuration
- Requires understanding of Mule layer architecture
- Higher computational complexity
- May over-optimize for small projects

---

### **3.  HYBRID APPROACHES** 

#### **Flow Similarity Planning** (`flow-similarity-detection.cypher`)
- **Focus**: Groups similar flows for efficiency
- **Best For**: Projects with many repetitive patterns
- **Combines With**: Layer-aware or improved planning

#### **Risk-Based Assignments** (`risk-based-assignments.cypher`)
- **Focus**: Team assignments based on risk tolerance
- **Best For**: Teams with varying skill levels
- **Combines With**: Any planning approach

---

##  CHOOSING THE RIGHT PLANNING APPROACH

### **Decision Matrix**

| Factor | Improved Sprint Planning | Layer-Aware Sprint Planning | Hybrid Approach |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------|
| **Project Size** | Small-Medium (< 50 flows) | Large (50+ flows) | Medium-Large |
| **Team Count** | 1-2 teams | 3+ teams | 2-3 teams |
| **Complexity** | Simple-Medium | High | Medium-High |
| **Dependencies** | Few | Many | Moderate |
| **Timeline** | Short (< 3 months) | Long (6+ months) | Medium (3-6 months) |
| **Risk Tolerance** | Low | Variable | Medium |
| **Setup Complexity** | Low | High | Medium |

### ** Selection Guidelines**

#### ** Use IMPROVED SPRINT PLANNING When:**
-  **Small to medium project** (< 50 flows)
-  **1-2 development teams**
-  **Simple risk-first strategy** needed
-  **Quick project start** required
-  **Minimal configuration** desired
-  **Proof-of-concept** or pilot migration

**Example Scenario**: *"We have 30 Mule flows to migrate with 2 teams over 3 months. Primary concern is handling high-risk flows early."*

#### ** Use LAYER-AWARE SPRINT PLANNING When:**
-  **Large enterprise project** (50+ flows)
-  **Multiple specialized teams** (3+ teams)
-  **Complex architectural dependencies**
-  **Team specialization** by Mule layers
-  **Long-term project** (6+ months)
-  **Compliance and governance** requirements

**Example Scenario**: *"We have 200 Mule flows across System, Process, and Experience layers with 5 specialized teams over 12 months. Need to ensure proper dependency management."*

#### ** Use HYBRID APPROACHES When:**
-  **Medium complexity** project
-  **Specific optimization needs** (similarity, risk, etc.)
-  **Custom requirements** not covered by standard approaches
-  **Iterative planning** approach

**Example Scenario**: *"We have 75 flows with many similar patterns and need both risk management and efficiency optimization."*

```

### **How It's Used**
1. **Application Owner Communication**: Show when their app will be migrated
2. **Environment Planning**: Coordinate deployment schedules
3. **Dependency Management**: Ensure proper sequencing of related applications
4. **Testing Coordination**: Plan integration testing schedules
5. **Business Impact Assessment**: Coordinate with business operations

### **Key Metrics**
- **Application Completion**: Track when each application is fully migrated
- **Risk Distribution**: Ensure high-risk flows are handled early
- **Team Coordination**: See which teams work on which applications
- **Timeline Adherence**: Monitor progress against planned schedules

### **Validation Methods**
```cypher
// Validate Application Coverage
MATCH (app:MuleApp)-[:HAS_FLOW]->(flow:Flow)
OPTIONAL MATCH (sb:SprintBacklog)
WHERE sb.appName = app.name AND sb.flowName = flow.flow
WITH app.name as Application,
     count(flow) as TotalFlows,
     count(sb) as ScheduledFlows
RETURN Application, TotalFlows, ScheduledFlows,
       CASE 
           WHEN ScheduledFlows = TotalFlows 
           THEN ' FULLY SCHEDULED'
           ELSE ' MISSING FLOWS: ' + toString(TotalFlows - ScheduledFlows)
       END as SchedulingStatus;

// Check Application Migration Timeline
MATCH (sb:SprintBacklog)
WITH sb.appName as Application,
     min(sb.sprintNumber) as FirstSprint,
     max(sb.sprintNumber) as LastSprint,
     count(DISTINCT sb.sprintNumber) as SprintsSpanned
RETURN Application, FirstSprint, LastSprint, SprintsSpanned,
       'Week ' + toString((FirstSprint-1)*2+1) + ' to Week ' + toString(LastSprint*2) as MigrationWindow,
       CASE 
           WHEN SprintsSpanned <= 4 
           THEN ' CONCENTRATED'
           ELSE ' SPREAD OUT'
       END as MigrationPattern;

##  **WEEKLY PROJECT TIMELINE**

### **What It Is**
The Weekly Project Timeline breaks down the 24-week project into weekly deliverables, showing exactly what work is happening each week with team assignments and milestones.

### **Sample Output**
```
Week | Sprint | Phase                | WorkType               | Applications      | Teams              | StoryPoints | Milestones
-----|--------|---------------------|------------------------|-------------------|--------------------|-------------|------------------
1    | 1      | PHASE 1: Foundation | System Layer Setup     | uhub-sapi, orders-api| Standard, Senior   | 22          | Project Kickoff
2    | 1      | PHASE 1: Foundation | Database Integrations  | uhub-sapi, payment-api| Standard, Senior   | 23          | Sprint 1 Demo

6    | 3      | PHASE 1: Foundation | Process Layer Prep     | orders-api, payment-api| Senior, Expert     | 19          | Sprint 3 Demo
...
23   | 12     | PHASE 4: Finalization| API Testing           | all applications  | Senior, Standard   | 11          | 
24   | 12     | PHASE 4: Finalization| Project Completion    | all applications  | All Teams          | 11          | Project Delivery
```

### **How It's Used**
1. **Weekly Planning**: Detailed week-by-week work breakdown
2. **Progress Tracking**: Monitor weekly deliverables and milestones
3. **Resource Scheduling**: Plan team availability and coordination
4. **Stakeholder Updates**: Weekly progress reports
5. **Risk Mitigation**: Early identification of timeline risks

### **Key Metrics**
- **Weekly Velocity**: 15-30 story points per week
- **Milestone Alignment**: Key deliverables aligned with business needs
- **Team Coordination**: Balanced team utilization
- **Phase Progression**: Logical progression through project phases

### **Validation Methods**
```cypher
// Validate Weekly Timeline Completeness
WITH range(1, 24) as AllWeeks
UNWIND AllWeeks as Week
OPTIONAL MATCH (sb:SprintBacklog)
WHERE sb.startWeek <= Week AND sb.endWeek >= Week
WITH Week, count(sb) as WorkItems, sum(sb.storyPoints) as StoryPoints
RETURN Week, WorkItems, COALESCE(StoryPoints, 0) as StoryPoints,
       CASE 
           WHEN WorkItems > 0 
           THEN ' WORK SCHEDULED'
           ELSE ' NO WORK SCHEDULED'
       END as WeekStatus;

// Check Weekly Workload Distribution
MATCH (sb:SprintBacklog)
UNWIND range(sb.startWeek, sb.endWeek) as Week
WITH Week, count(sb) as StoryCount, sum(sb.storyPoints) as StoryPoints
RETURN Week, StoryCount, StoryPoints,
       CASE 
           WHEN StoryPoints BETWEEN 15 AND 35 
           THEN ' BALANCED WEEK'
           WHEN StoryPoints > 35 
           THEN ' OVERLOADED WEEK'
           ELSE ' UNDERLOADED WEEK'
       END as WeeklyWorkload
ORDER BY Week;
```
