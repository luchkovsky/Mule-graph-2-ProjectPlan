##  AGILE STORY POINTS METHODOLOGY

### **What Are Story Points?**

Story points are a unit of measure used to estimate the relative effort required to complete a user story or task. In our migration project, story points represent the **complexity and effort** required to migrate individual Mule flows to Apache Camel.

### **Our Story Points Calculation Formula**

```
Story Points = Base Complexity + Risk Multiplier + API Bonus + DataWeave Complexity
```

**Components:**
- **Base Complexity**: Connector count, step count, architectural complexity
- **Risk Multiplier**: High-risk flows get 1.5x multiplier
- **API Bonus**: API-exposed flows get additional points
- **DataWeave Complexity**: Transformation logic complexity

### **Story Point Categories**

| Category | Points Range | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **TINY** | 1-2 | Simple flows, minimal logic | Basic HTTP listener |
| **SMALL** | 3-5 | Simple integration, basic transformation | Database query with simple mapping |
| **MEDIUM** | 6-8 | Moderate complexity, some business logic | API with validation and transformation |
| **LARGE** | 9-13 | Complex integration, multiple systems | Multi-system orchestration |
| **VERY_LARGE** | 14-20 | Very complex flows, extensive logic | Complex business process |
| **EPIC** | 21+ | Extremely complex, requires breakdown | Major integration hub |

### **Complexity Scoring Factors**

1. **Structural Complexity**
   - Direct steps: 2 points each
   - Nested steps: 4 points each
   - Deep nested steps: 6 points each

2. **Integration Complexity**
   - Connectors: 3 points each
   - Error handlers: 1 point each

3. **DataWeave Complexity**
   - DW scripts: 3 points each
   - Average complexity: 2 points per complexity level
   - Maximum complexity: 1 point per complexity level

4. **API Complexity**
   - API kit routes: 2 points each
   - API schemas: 4 points each
   - API actions: 1 point each

## 📉 BURN DOWN METHODOLOGY

### **What is Burn Down?**

A **Burn Down Chart** tracks the amount of work remaining in a sprint or project over time. It helps teams visualize progress and identify potential delivery risks.

### **Our Burn Down Approach**

#### **Sprint Burn Down**
- **X-Axis**: Days in sprint (1-10 working days)
- **Y-Axis**: Remaining story points
- **Target Line**: Linear decrease from sprint total to zero
- **Actual Line**: Daily remaining work tracking

#### **Project Burn Down**
- **X-Axis**: Sprint number (1-12)
- **Y-Axis**: Remaining story points (720 total)
- **Target Line**: 60 points per sprint reduction
- **Actual Line**: Cumulative completion tracking

### **Burn Down Metrics**

1. **Velocity**: Average story points completed per sprint
2. **Trend Line**: Linear regression of completion rate
3. **Variance**: Difference between planned and actual completion
4. **Forecast**: Projected completion date based on current velocity

### **Burn Down Analysis**

- **Ahead of Schedule**: Actual line below target line
- **On Schedule**: Actual line matches target line
- **Behind Schedule**: Actual line above target line
- **Scope Creep**: Upward movement in remaining work

| **Setup Complexity** | Low | High | Medium |

### ** Selection Guidelines**

#### ** Use IMPROVED SPRINT PLANNING When:**
-  **Small to medium project** (< 50 flows)
-  **1-2 development teams**
-  **Simple risk-first strategy** needed
-  **Quick project start** required
-  **Minimal configuration** desired
-  **Proof-of-concept** or pilot migration

**Example Scenario**: *"We have 30 Mule flows to migrate with 2 teams over 3 months. Primary concern is handling high-risk flows early."*

#### ** Use LAYER-AWARE SPRINT PLANNING When:**
-  **Large enterprise project** (50+ flows)
-  **Multiple specialized teams** (3+ teams)
-  **Complex architectural dependencies**
-  **Team specialization** by Mule layers
-  **Long-term project** (6+ months)
-  **Compliance and governance** requirements

**Example Scenario**: *"We have 200 Mule flows across System, Process, and Experience layers with 5 specialized teams over 12 months. Need to ensure proper dependency management."*

#### ** Use HYBRID APPROACHES When:**
-  **Medium complexity** project
-  **Specific optimization needs** (similarity, risk, etc.)
-  **Custom requirements** not covered by standard approaches
-  **Iterative planning** approach

**Example Scenario**: *"We have 75 flows with many similar patterns and need both risk management and efficiency optimization."*
